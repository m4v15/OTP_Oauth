# Testing the Oauth from a client on OTP

Simple app to test the oauth flow of the [Nazareth Open Tourism Platform](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/open-tourism-platform)

This will only work with your own client details of an app registered on the platform. Please raise an issue here on on the platform repo if you would like more information

This is currently set up to work with a local version of the platform running, where the GET user route has been made to a secure route (it is open on the live platform).
